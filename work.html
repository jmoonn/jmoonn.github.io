														<img src="images/ticktbox.png" alt="Images" width="100" class="fh5co-align-left img-responsive">
														<p>ticktBox is an online ticketing and marketing platform. It works with entertainment companies such as Lionsgate,
														Sony Pictures, Fox Searchlight Screenings, Warner Brothers, and much more. ticktBox allows these companies to create campaigns
														movies, screenings, sweepstakes, and events. It also allows these clients to distribute tickets, keep track of marketing data,
														and review sales records. </p>
													</br>
														<h2 class="fh5co-uppercase-heading-sm text-left">My contribution.</h2>
														<img src="images/wbpage.jpg" alt="Images" width="200" class="fh5co-align-right img-responsive">
														<p>At ticktBox, I was a Web Graphic Design Intern. For ticktBox, I created prototypes and wireframes for clients
														Warner Bros. and Fox Searchlight Screenings. Although small projects, I created web pages that promoted the mobile
														applications for these two companies. For Warner Bros., I stuck with the 3D bokeh background the site had already implemented
														and created a page that made the icons pop, along with a 3 dimensional iPhone. In contrast, for Fox Searchlight Screenings,
														I stuck with a 2 dimensional style, in which the iPhone and text pops more due to color intensity. In addition to these
														webpages, I was able to work with teams of, on average, 3-4 people (myself, included) to discuss color schemes, points
														of interest and emphasis, and other design decisions. </p>
													</br>
														<h2 class="fh5co-uppercase-heading-sm text-left">The process and what I learned.</h2>
														<p>My internship at ticktBox was my first "real word experience" in the world of design and I certainly learned a great deal.
														When first given these projects, I overestimated my abilities and underestimated the work that goes into them. I learned
														about planning and first discussing with a team before getting started. I had to keep consistences in typography, color schemes,
														and the emotions users would feel when navigating a page. These things seem quite obvious, but until this internship, I had not
														realized the importance of consistency in a webpage. The two webpages mentioned earlier were great baby steps into design. From
														there, I was able to work on Gofobo Local, a sub-brand that ticktBox operates. It was the project in which I learned the most from
														at my time at ticktBox as well as my greatest contribution to ticktBox. Click on the next tab to learn more about it! </p>

													<img src="images/GofoboLocalLogo.jpg" alt="Images" width="100" class="fh5co-align-left img-responsive">
													<p>Gofobo Local is a sub-brand of ticktBox. Branching from their original platform <a href="https://gofobo.com" color="F15156">Gofobo</a>,
													which brings users entertainment opportunities from all over the nation, Gofobo Local allows users to first search by their region to find local entertainment news, sweepstakes, screenings and events. Gofobo
												 	Local features 7 different regions across the nation. It takes away the constant search of finding LOCAL entertainment and brings the opportunities
													to the user. </p>
												</br>
													<h2 class="fh5co-uppercase-heading-sm text-left">My contribution.</h2>
													<img src="images/Sweepstakes.jpg" alt="Images" width="300" class="fh5co-align-right img-responsive">
													<img src="images/GofoboLocalHome.jpg" alt="Images" width="300" class="fh5co-align-right img-responsive">
													<p>For Gofobo Local, I designed and created wireframes for all their main pages such as Gofobo Local's home landing page, regional pages, screenings page, sweepstakes page, and events page. I also
													created mobile versions of the listed pages. Other side projects for Gofobo Local incldued a Gofobo Local pre-announcement e-mail and Gofobo Local's toolbox kit. As a side
													project, I also createad a toolbox kit for Gofobo, since they were lacking one, as well as an e-mail announcement for their new ticketing app.  Gofobo Local's homepage
													allows users to click through an interactive map to find their region. Regional pages allow users to find the most recent news, screenings, sweepstakes, and events.
													This page was designed and inspired to replicate a social media feed. Screenings, sweepstakes, and events pages allow users to see a list of each respective ongoing item in a
													user's local region.
													</p>
												</br>
													<h2 class="fh5co-uppercase-heading-sm text-left">The process and what I learned.</h2>
													<img src="images/Regional.jpg" alt="Images" width="150" class="fh5co-align-left img-responsive">
													<p>Designing the wireframes and coming up with the designs for Gofobo Local took approximately 3-4 weeks, including revisions, meetings, ideation, etc.
													It was one of the biggest learning experiences, personally, in design. I loved that I got to work hands-on on a project but I also realized I had so much
												 	to learn. Each page has had a number of revisions from what I originally submitted and the final product is far from what I had originally submitted.
													At first, I was quite discouraged but I realized that design is all about revisions, user testing, discussion, and making design decisions to make
													the user's experience easy and pleasing. I learned briefly about color theory, about making areas of focus "pop", about proportions, about limitations,
													and much more. The biggest challenge for me was designing the Regional Landing Page. In this page, users can see all local entertainment news, screenings,
													sweepstakes, and events. The team at ticktBox working on Gofobo Local with me wanted to implement a social media feed inspired design, while also adding
													advertisements, links to Gofobo Local's social media accounts, and ways to navigate to other pages. When designing a wireframe for this page, I had
													an extremely difficult time getting the newsfeed to grab the user's attention while also not letting the rest of the content be completely washed out.
													Through this challenge, I met with the creative director, met more frequently with my team and was able to discuss different avenues, branch out new ideas,
													and expand my thoughts. I learned about working with a team, focusing on what is important and plausible, keeping consistency, etc. A surprising
													habit I learned to do was explore -  to constantly explore different websites, examine different websites, and start noticing designs. It allowed
													me to see new designs, good designs, bad designs, and kept me aware and conscious of what I was looking at.<br />
													After creating desktop wireframes, I moved onto mobile wireframes, which were much easier since I designed in a loosely enforced grid layout.
													I learned about grid layouts through a research report I was working on in conjuction with this internship and it helped me a great deal.  Please let me know
													if you would like to read it - I'd be more than happy to share it with you. <br />
													I also learned so much about consistency - the trust, familiarty, and ease it brings to a user. I also learned consistency can be quite difficult. This
													was a main reason I created a company toolbox branding kit. When I entered the company, many of the employees did not even know what font their own website
													was using. When leaving, I left them with a simple, minimal toolbox branding kit with their company font, colors, spacing, logos, etc. Although I did help
													with the company's consistency, I learned about consistency that cannot be "recorded" such as font family, color, etc. For example, ticktBox and Gofobo's
													iconography, style, etc was more flat with just a tad a bit of dimension. Trying to match that proved to be a challenge at times. But it allowed me to learn and grow, as a designer.</s>

													<h2 class="fh5co-uppercase-heading-sm text-left">What is idea8?</h2>
													<img src="images/idea8.png" alt="Images" width="100" class="fh5co-align-left img-responsive">
													<p>idea8 was a project I and 6 others made in my COGS187A (Usability & Info Architecture) course at UCSD. idea8 is a digital version of Google's Design Stunt called Crazy 8's. Crazy 8's is a quick, interactive way for designers to force out raw, rough ideas and then share
													to further build upon each other's ideas and possibly create new or collaborative ideas. It is a way for design teams to find direction, force out creativity, etc. So idea8
											 		takes this and allows users to do this, digitally because it is often difficult for members of large teams to have matching schedules. idea8 allows teams to ideate and give feedback,
													remotely. It gives users anywhere between 1-3 minutes to come up with ideas and then time to give feedback and receive feedback on ideas. It also allows individuals without a team to
													create ideas and share the link with whomever they want to receive feedback from (so that they don't absolutely need a team to work with). It encourages multiple iterations and collaboration. </p>
												</br>
													<h2 class="fh5co-uppercase-heading-sm text-left">My contribution.</h2>
													<img src="images/Restart.png" alt="Images" width="300" class="fh5co-align-left img-responsive">
													<p>Since this was a group project, we split work evenly and lots of the work overlapped. I helped collect user research about, first, "Creativity". Moving on from there, I helped to create ideas
													on what our website would focus on. After settling on the idea of "idea8", I created Personas and Storyboards to help our group better focus on a target group and to better get a feel for how
													users would use our site. I then helped with user testing. And after hashing out rough prototypes, I helped to refine the final prototype by taking part in color scheme, font family, font size,
													vibes the site would give, etc. Moving onto implementation, I created the "Restart" page, asking users if they would like to re-start the process of ideating and giving feedback. idea8 encourages
													multiple iterations because it allows more ideas to be exposed and to build upon each other. In addition, I created a uniform CSS for the group so that all font sizes, colors, buttons, and anything
													else that needed to be consistent, would be consistent across all the pages.
													</p>
												</br>
													<h2 class="fh5co-uppercase-heading-sm text-left">The process and what I learned.</h2>
													<img src="images/IMG_5646.JPG" alt="Images" width="150" class="fh5co-align-right img-responsive">
													<p>First, our group decided that we wanted to go with the theme of creativity. We wanted to know what it meant to people, what people loved about it, how people thought it died, how they expressed
													creativity, why they were stumped and how they overcame "creative blocks". We did user research, recording interviews on post-its so that when we met, we could physically organize our thoughts to
													see themes, repeated answers, etc. We realized people had a wide variety of what they thought about creativity. Some people thought it branched from others while others thought real creativity
													was something an individual created without any inspiration from anyone else. In addition, people wanted feedback but were often afraid of it because they were afraid of being judged. After going
													through multiple iterations of ideations and re-organizing the post-its, we decided to go with Google's Design Sprint Crazy 8's but with greater flexibility. This would allow users
													to work alone or with others and allow people to receive feedback from only the people they wanted to receive feedback on.
													<img src="images/storyboard.jpeg" alt="Images" width="250" class="fh5co-align-left img-responsive">
													After creating an idea (we, ourselves, did Crazy 8's to come up with this idea!), we created storyboards and personas to have a better grasp of who our users would be. We wanted to put ourselves
													in the user's shoes. We came up with a plethora of storyboards and personas to help us further refine our idea and the features we wanted to implement. And from here, we created low fidelity prototypes.
													First, we simply used paper and pen so it would be easy to make changes. From here, we used Marvel to create a more refined prototype - still based, largely, on our low fidelity sketches. Using
													the high fidelity prototype from Marvel, we did user testing to see what parts of our website would be confusing, what people liked, what people didn't like, etc. Based on feedback, we made changes
													accordingly and were able to see what was working for us and what wasn't. I had never realized the power of user research and user testing until this project. It was a great way to learn more about it
													and to first hand experience the impact of user research/testing. Participants were surprisingly honest and gave good feedback that greatly helped our final project. We then made design decisions: font family,
													font size, color scheme, etc. And from here, we began implementation. This was my first time actually working with HTML & CSS and I can definitely say that I had to pass a learning curve to get the hang of it.
													It was a great learning experience and learned a great deal about the possibilites and limitations of implementation. To learn more about the process of the creation of idea8, read our Medium blog <a href="https://medium.com/potato-cogs-187a" color="F15156">here</a>, updated
													weekly through the process. *Due to some confusion, after week 4, some posts were lost and the rest can be found <a href="https://medium.com/tag/cogs-187a" color="F15156">here</a>.
